# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-project


This is my Data Analytics capstone project on IBM
I assumed the role of a Data Analyst for a large international IT and business consulting organisation that is renowned for its knowledge of IT solutions and its staff of highly skilled IT experts. The company frequently analyses data to help determine future skill requirements in order to be competitive and keep up with rapidly evolving technologies. I will be supporting this program as a data analyst, and I have been given the responsibility of gathering information from various sources and spotting trends for this year's report on developing skills.

So each process in analysing the data is stored in the Jupyter notebooks that are uploaded.
Week 1 data collection
My first task is to gather a list of the most in-demand programming skills from job advertising, training websites, and polls, among other sources. In order to gather data in many formats like.csv files, excel sheets, and databases, I will start by scraping internet websites and using APIs.

Week 2 data wrangling
Data wrangling techniques will be used to prepare the acquired data for analysis.

Week 3 exploratory data analysis
Once I've retrieved and cleaned enough data, I will use statistical methods to analyse the data.

Week 4 data visualisation
Involves creating charts and graphs to visualise the data in Python

Week 5 building a dashboard
I used IBM Cognos Analytics to build a dashboard that compiled all of the data as well as  spot trends and insights that might include the following: Top 10 Pragramming Languages and Databases Worked with by Respondents

Week 6 presentation of findings.
I use storytelling to share my findings in a presentation.
